#### Welcome to my playground

I am Nitin Mohan and this is my blog where I experiment with random tech, write about things that interest me and serves as a place for me to record my thoughts and experiments.

I am primarily a backend developer with almost 9 years of experience. I often find myself coding in Java, Scala, Go, and sometimes Python. Over the years, I have had the pleasure of working with various SQL and NoSQL databases.

I'm passionate about distributed computing, and obsessive about refining system architectures.
