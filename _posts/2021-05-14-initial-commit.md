Welcome to the beginning of a series of experiments and thought recording process. There are no rules, just a single guiding principle:
> How, and why?

I want this place to serve as a place where I can run my own experiments, try out different ideas, and maybe once in a while try expanding on something I already know but not quite. A great place to learn and perhaps, teach.


I don't yet have any ideas or thoughts on what I want to write about during these first few days, but I'll try to put out something as time permits.
